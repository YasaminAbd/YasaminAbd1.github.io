          <p>I've always been fascinated by technology, but my real journey into programming began when I started wondering how apps and software are created.</p>
          <p>My curiosity led me to C++, my first programming language, which I learned through online tutorials and YouTube videos.</p>
          <p>After some time, I decided to formalize my education by studying ICT at HZ University, where I hope to turn my curiosity into expertise and develop real-world skills.</p>
